# Violet Ice Light Theme for VSCode

First swing at a custom theme, strong colors and simple highlighting - this is not yet published but can be installed locally, just download the file from `./builds/` and run `Extension: Install from VSIX...` to get it going

Will likely capture screenshots when this is ready for publishings
